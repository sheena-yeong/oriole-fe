## Oriole

Armed with a personal goal of understanding how technology integrates with finance, I tasked myself with building a minimally functioning cryptocurrency application. This app allows you to browse the top 250 cryptocurrencies, learn more about their history, add them to a watchlist to monitor their performance, top up your wallet, and use the balance to purchase cryptocurrencies that interest you. Note that this app assumes zero transaction fees for simplicity.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework:** React + Vite
- **Backend Framework:** Node.js
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Payment Service:** Stripe
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Radix UI Library, Recharts, React Icons
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Sequelize
- **Caching:** Redis
- **HTTP Request Library:** Axios
- **Crypto Data APIs:** CoinyBubble (Fear & Greed Index), CoinGecko (Market Data)
